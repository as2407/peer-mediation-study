One day, Ruby taught me this really cool trick to kick the ball far, and we started playing more afterwards. I was going to tell Jacob! I was just not trying to do it right away because I knew he'd be upset and I didn't want to deal with it. Anyway, this past week, Jacob has been saying stuff right when I pass him in the hallway. I get it. He's mad. But also, it was just getting old– he should have just said something to my face. Then when we were at lunch the other day, when I saw him, he said something to my face, and I kinda snapped. I didn't hit him... I just grabbed his shoulder because I wanted to talk or whatever. He looked mad and he shoved me. Before I could get a hit in, the teacher yelled at us and sent us down here. So, yeah, that’s what happened."
